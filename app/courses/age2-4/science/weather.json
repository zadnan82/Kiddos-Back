        "content": "Let's celebrate all the weather we learned about! First, let's be the bright sun! Stretch your arms wide and smile big. Next, let's be gentle rain! Wiggle your fingers as raindrops fall down. Then, let's be the wind! Sway and move like leaves in the breeze. Now, let's be fluffy clouds! Float and move slowly across the sky. Finally, let's be snowflakes! Spin gently and land softly. All weather is special! Sun gives us light. Rain helps plants grow. Wind moves things around. Clouds make shapes in the sky. Snow makes everything magical. You know so much about weather! You are a weather expert!",
