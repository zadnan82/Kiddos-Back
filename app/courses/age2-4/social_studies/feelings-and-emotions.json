Mad feelings make us want to stomp, but we cool down safely. Scared feelings make us want to hide, but we find brave helpers. Excited feelings make us want to bounce and dance. Surprised feelings make our eyes big and wide. All feelings are okay to have! Everyone has all these feelings. Grown-ups have feelings too. When we have big feelings, we can talk about them. We can say, 'I feel happy!' or 'I feel sad.' We can ask for help with our feelings. We can help others with their feelings too. Feelings make us human and special. Let's practice all our feeling faces together!",
